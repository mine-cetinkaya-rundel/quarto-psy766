# Reproducible data analysis

## Reproducibility checklist {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
What does it mean for a data analysis to be ‚Äúreproducible‚Äù?
:::

. . .

**Bare minimum:**

-   Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?

-   Does the code actually do what you think it does?

-   In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?

**A bit more ambitious:**

-   Can the code be used for other data?

-   Can you extend the code to do other things?

# What is Quarto?

## Quarto ...

-   is a new, open-source, scientific, and technical publishing system
-   aims to make the process of creating and collaborating dramatically better

::: incremental
-   Consistent implementation of attractive and handy features across outputs: tabsets, code-folding, syntax highlighting, etc.
-   More accessible defaults as well as better support for accessibility
-   Guardrails, particularly helpful for new learners: YAML completion, informative syntax errors, etc.
-   Support for other languages like Python, Julia, Observable, and more via Jupyter engine for executable code chunks.
